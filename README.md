# Price Prediction for Used Cars

For this project, we are given a dataset 'Cars.csv', which is a dataset containing sales of second-hand cars. The dataset contains information for brands, models, prices etc of second-hand cars.

For this project, we will first start by checking what is inside the dataset, and perform data manipulation and cleansing as necessary. After that we will proceed to exploratory data analysis, and subsequently build a linear regression model, which is aimed to predict the price of second-hand cars (target variable is 'Price'). Once the model is built, a simple demostration for model deployment will be provided.
