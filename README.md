# Price Prediction for Used Cars

For this project, we are given a dataset 'Cars.csv', which is a dataset containing sales of second-hand cars. The dataset contains information for brands, models, prices etc of second-hand cars.

For this project, we will first start by checking what is inside the dataset, and perform data manipulation and cleansing as necessary. After that we will proceed to exploratory data analysis, and subsequently build a linear regression model, which is aimed to predict the price of second-hand cars (target variable is 'Price'). Once the model is built, a simple demostration for model deployment will be provided.

Below are the .ipynb files for this project:
1. Price Prediction for Used Cars.ipynb

   For data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis and model building.

2. Price Prediction for Used Cars_For Module.ipynb
   
   For converting into a .py module (Price_Prediction_for_Used_Cars_Module.py) which will be used for subsequent model deployment.

3. Price Prediction for Used Cars_Model Deployment.ipynb
   
   Simple demonstration for model deployment using the .py module.
